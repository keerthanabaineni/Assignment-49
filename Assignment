1.write a program to find sum and division and the answer will be in integers.
a=20
b=10
#addition of two numbers
sum=int(a)+int(b)
print(f"the sum is{sum}")
#division of two numbers
divide=int(a)//int(b)
print(f"the divide is{divide}")
Output:
>>the sum is 30
>>the divide is 2

2.write program to perform substraction and power of  the numbers.
first_number=int(input("enter the first number"))
second_number=int(input("enter the second number"))
#performing the substraction 
sub=first_number-second_number
print(sub)
#performing the power of the numbers
power=first_number**second_number
print(power)
output:
>>enter the first number 6
>>enter the second number 3
>>sub=3
>>power=216

3.write a program to find the area of rhombus.
#entering the first diagonal
d1=int(input("enter the first diagonal"))
#entering the second diagonal
d2=int(input("enter the second diagonal"))
area=(d1*d2)/2
print(f"area of rhombus is{area}")
output:
>>enter the first diagonal 6
>>enter the second diagonal 8
>>area=24

4.write a program to find given triangle is either equilateral,isosceles scalene.
#entering the first side
a=int(input("enter the first side"))
#entering the second side
b=int(input("enter the second side"))
#entering the third side
c=int(input("enter the third side"))
if a==b==c:
    print("it is a equilateral traingle")
elif a==b!=c:
 print("it is a isosceles traingle")
elif a!=b==c:
 print("it is a isosceles traingle")
else:
    print("it is scalene  traingle")
output:
>>enter the first side 15
>>enter the second side 15
>>enter the third side 15
>>it is a equilateral  triangle
>>enter the first side 20
>>enter the second side 14
>>enter the third side 20
>>it is a isosceles traingle

5.write a program to find  distance between the two points.
x1=int(input("enter the x1"))
x2=int(input("enter the x2"))
y1=int(input("enthe the y1"))
y2=int(input("enter the y2"))
distance=(((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2))**0.5
print(f"the distance between(x1,x2)and (y1,y2)is {distance}")
output:
>>enter the x1 4
>>enter the x2 6
>>enter the y1 0
>>enter the y2 6
the distance between (4,6)and(0,6) is 6.32455

6.write a program to find letters in a name.
name=input("enter a name")
length=len(name)
print(f"your name has {length}letters")
output:
>>name=keerthana
>>your name has 9 letters


7.write a program to find out how many days,months we have left if we live until 100 years old.
age=int(input("enter your age "))
years_left=100-age
days_left=years_left*365
months_left=years_left*12
weeks_left=years_left*52
print(f"you have {days_left} days.{weeks_left}weeks and {months_left}months left")
output:
>>enter the age 18
>>you have 29930 days 4264 weeks and 984 months left

8.write a program to print the digit at one's place  of a number.
num=int(input("enter a number")
digit_at_onces_place=num%10
print("the digit at ones place of "+str(num)+"is"+str(digit at ones place))
output:
>>enter any number 12345
the digit at ones place of 12345 is 5

9.write a program to find the simple interest.
pr=int(input("enter the pricipal value"))
time =int(input("enter the time"))
rate=int(input("enter the rate"))
si=(pr*time*rate)/100
print(f"the simple intrest is {si}")
output:
>>enter the pricipal value 2000
enter the time 4
enter the rate 3
the simple intrest is 240

10.write a program to find the bmi and his health.
weight=float(input("enter weightin kg"))
height=float(input("enter height in meters"))
bmi=weight/height**2
if bmi<18.5:
  print(f"your BMi is{bmi}and you are under weight")
  elif bmi<25:
        print(f"your BMI is {bmi}and have a normal weight")
  elif bmi<30:
        print(f"your BMI is {bmi}and you have over weight")
  elif bmi<35:
        print(f"yourBMI is{bmi} and you have obesed")
else:
   print(f"your BMI is {bmi} and you  are clinically obesed")
    
output:
enter the weight in kgs 49
enter the height in meters 1.6
bmi=19.141406
>>your bmi is 19.14 and have normal weight.
 
11.write a program to find average of three numbers.
